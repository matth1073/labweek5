Recommend using vectors over arrays

Your choice if you want to use a header and corresponding cpp file for functions

Don't need any type of menu, program should continuosly run until user enters 'Q' or 'q'

When adding/multiplying may be easier to first create a matrix
that will be the correct size and contain 0 at each position 

adding can be done with a nested for loop 
for
	for
	
multiplication can be done with a nested for loop inside a nested for loop
for 
	for
		for


3 checks for adding
-size() cant be NULL or zero
-number of rows must match
-number of cols must match

2 checks for multiplying
-size() cant be NULL or zero
-number of matrix A columns must equal number of matrix B rows 

e.g 	(2x2) x (2x3)
This is valid multiplication
	  
	(2x3) x (2x2)
This is invalid multiplication 
	  
(2X3) x (3x2) would create a (2x2) 
(3x2) x (2x3) would create a (3x3)  
	  
error handling: 
can assume valid input for all integer inputs

program should only do VALID multiplication and additions, inform user if they cannot add or multiply because of size, program should not crash

user may press any key to run program again
